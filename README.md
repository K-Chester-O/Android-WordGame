The starts screen is working now.
The current version of the the start screen set 7 words for the functions to test them.
Later this function will clear any inputs - > 
Setting all of the words to hello using the clear button.
Toasts are not working on the process screen i think i need a layout for it.
The check against dictionary method is somewhat working doesnâ€™t return the correct result, i put hello in the file.
The next method  checkforcharacters is breaking.
