# WordGame
Version 1
----------------------------------------------------------
The starts screen is working now.
The current version of the the start screen sets 7 words for the functions to test them.
Also displays the source word correctly. The clear button will clear all the input later when process.java is working correctly.
Toasts are not working on the process screen i think i need a layout for it.
The check against dictionary method is somewhat working doesnâ€™t return the correct result, i put hello in the file.
The next method checkforcharacters is breaking.
